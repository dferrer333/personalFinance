# Personal Finance Manager
This project is an attempt to integrate the Plaid API and other resources in order for people to simply view their transaction histories in helpful ways.

## What is this app intended to do?
* Give people easy daily, weekly, and monthly digests of their personal financial history.
* Maybe a table of all transactions could be filterable by category, search, date, etc.
* Simple financial analytics like category with most money spent, category with most frequent transactions, net income vs expense, etc.
  * Could be displayed with graphs, tables, and other creative graphics (some that are compatible with react?)
  * Simple recommendations for users on how to improve certain areas of their finances.
* Financial goal setting, and reminders/updates settings?

## Why would this app be helpful?
There is so much overhead with dealing with personal finances:
* Sifting through and categorizing transactions
* Pin-pointing where most money is being spent, figuring out the most troubling areas of one's finances, etc.
* Keeping up with it like a habit, hence the benefit of reminders and automatic analyses.

## Who is this app being designed for?
This app is intended for the average person with several personal savings, checking, and investment accounts as well as liabilities like credit lines and loans.  **It is meant to enable common people to more easily understand themselves financially**.
