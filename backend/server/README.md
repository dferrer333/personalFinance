## Getting Started

### `.env.local`

When configuring the server, make sure to create a `.env.local` file in your server's root directory.  It should contain the following `KEY=VALUE` pairs:

```
HOST_PORT=some_valid_port
HTTPS_PATH=path_to_https_keys_and_certs
PUBLIC_PATH=path_to_public_dir
ROOT=path_to_server_root
```
